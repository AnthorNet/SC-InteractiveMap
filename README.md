<!-- REMOTE LOADING -->
## Remote save loading

You can remotely load a dedicated server save by appending **?url=SAVE_LINK** to the interactive map URL.  
The server needs to send the save file with a valid SSL certificate and CORS enabled.  

```nginx
server {
    server_name             satisfactory.domain; # Dedicated server domain
    root                    /home/steam/.config/Epic/FactoryGame/Saved/SaveGames/server; # SAVE FOLDER

    listen                  443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate         /etc/letsencrypt/live/satisfactory.domain/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key     /etc/letsencrypt/live/satisfactory.domain/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot    
    include                 /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam             /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

    # Make the save loadable by the map
    add_header              Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Access-Control-Allow-Origin";
    add_header              Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://satisfactory-calculator.com";

    if($request_method = OPTIONS){
        return 200;
    }
 }
